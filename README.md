# Thank you for your consideration
This repository is meant to showcase my ability to write code that is simple, legible, and provides value to a team environment.

## Script Descriptions
- **aws_session_cache.py**: Enables teams to use the AWS CLI cache in their scritps, inheriting short-lived priviledged sessions from MFA restricted roles
- **aws_ssm.py**: A convenience class to support developers with quick secure defaults when using SSM Parameter Store to retrieve, put, and list secrets
- **mongo_atlas_api.py**: A library that interacts with the MongoDb Atlas API and supports the work of database administrators in reviewing database logs and executing user management tasks
- **urldecode.py**: A small CLI utility that decodes URLs and aids in the examination of API requests, HTTP redirects, and frontend routes
